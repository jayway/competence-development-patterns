#### Context
Some members of the group has different experiences and/or problems and would like to discuss them with others. Other members of the group want input on other’s experiences and problems.

#### Description [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference):

Process:
 * Marketplace: the participants introduces discussion topics to the group and add them to a physical board.
 * Unconference: the participants choose whatever sessions they want to attend.
 * Debrief [Optional]: What are your key take-aways? What surprised you?

Law of two feet: If at any time during our time together you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet, go someplace else.

It’s good if the session leader takes notes.

#### Preparation
Each participant tries to prepare a few ideas for the marketplace, if possible.

#### Pros
The most important and interesting topics tend to get crowded, which is noteworthy for the future.

#### Cons
Relies on some properties of the group that is not always there, such as diverse experiences, willingness to share, communication skills, etc.
