#### Context
Some members of the group have different experiences and/or problems and would like to discuss them with others. Different members of the group may desire input on their own experiences and problems.

#### Description [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference):

Process:
 * Marketplace: the participants introduces discussion topics to the group and add them to a physical board.
 * Unconference: the participants choose whatever sessions they want to attend.
 * Debrief [Optional]: What are your key take-aways? What surprised you?

Law of two feet: If at any time during our time together you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet, go someplace else.

Itâ€™s good if the session leader takes notes.

#### Preparation
Each participant tries to prepare a few ideas for the marketplace, if possible.

#### Pros
The most important and interesting topics tend to get crowded, which is noteworthy for the future.

#### Cons
Relies on some properties of the group that are not always there, such as diverse experiences, willingness to share, communication skills, etc.
