### Problem based lab

#### Context
The group has some hands-on experience with a technology or idea and wants to dig deeper.

#### Description
In software development, practical experience with a technology or idea is very valuable. One way to practice is to do a lab. It's good if there is a shorter presentation first on the subject, at least to give the context behind why the subject is interesting in the first place.

One style of lab is:

* automated tests
* hints
* a solution available

Another style of lab is more free, e.g. develop a voting web app in [technique].

#### Preparation
One needs to prepare a short introduction. Depending on the contraints and goals, preparing the lab can take very long time, so it's a good idea to see if there already are some labs on the web that fits what you have in mind - this can save a lot of time. You can choose to do the lab yourself before the session or not. Make sure that the goal for the lab is clear. It’s also good to think about how to get everybody started quickly - maybe write out a suggestion for the first few things to do.

#### Pros
As mentioned above, practical experience is very valuable. It also gives the group a common experience and it can relate back to that experience (which is also a risk, if the lab is not good).

#### Cons
Labs require longer sessions and there is a risk that the group doesn't get enough back for the invested time and effort.
