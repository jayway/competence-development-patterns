### Problem based lab

#### Context
The group has some hands-on experience with a certain technology or idea and wants to dig deeper.

#### Description
In software development, practical experience with a particular technology or idea is very valuable. One way to practice is to do a lab. It's good if there is first a shorter presentation on the subject, at least to give the context behind why the subject is interesting in the first place.

One style of lab is:

* automated tests
* hints
* a solution available

Another style of lab is more free, e.g. develop a voting web app in [technique].

#### Preparation
One needs to prepare a short introduction. Depending on the constraints and goals, preparing the lab can take a very long time, so it's a good idea to see if there already are some labs on the web that fit what you have in mind - this can save a lot of time. You can choose to do the lab yourself before the session or not. Make sure that the goal for the lab is clear. Itâ€™s also good to think about how to get everybody started quickly - maybe write out a suggestion for the first few things to do.

#### Pros
As mentioned above, practical experience is very valuable. It also gives the group a common experience and it can relate back to that experience (which is also a risk, if the lab is not good).

#### Cons
Labs require longer sessions and there is a risk that the group doesn't get enough back for the invested time and effort.
